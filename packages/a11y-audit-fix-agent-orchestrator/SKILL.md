# Accessibility Orchestrator

Coordinates the complete accessibility audit workflow by directing AI to use specialized a11y skills in sequence.

## CRITICAL: Autonomous Execution

**This workflow runs autonomously without stopping.** Do NOT:
- Stop to ask "Would you like me to apply fixes?"
- Pause between stages for confirmation
- Request permission before making changes
- Break the workflow into multiple interactions

**Execute all three stages in a single continuous run.** The user has already requested an audit—that is your authorization to complete the entire workflow.

```

## Prerequisites

Before running an audit, ensure the `a11y-base-web` skill has been loaded. It provides foundational patterns all other skills rely on.

## Stage 1: Analysis

Run static analysis first to identify potential issues, then validate with automated testing, then compare results to plan remediation.

### Step 1A: Static Analysis (INITIAL SCAN)

**Start with static code analysis** using the `web-standards` skill to catch structural issues early:
- Missing or improper ARIA attributes
- Semantic HTML problems (div soup, missing landmarks)
- Keyboard accessibility patterns in custom widgets
- Form labeling issues
- Image accessibility

This gives you a preliminary list of potential issues and builds context for what to look for in automated testing.

### Step 1B: Automated Testing (RUNTIME VALIDATION)

**Next, run axe-core via Playwright** to validate against the actual rendered page. Read and apply the `a11y-tester` skill:

1. Start a local server if testing a local file (`python3 -m http.server`)
2. Run the `a11y-tester` skill against the target URL (or local server URL)
3. Collect the `violations` and `incomplete` arrays from results

Do not call low-level browser tools directly from the orchestrator unless `a11y-tester` is unavailable.

**Note:** The a11y-tester skill returns raw violations when called by the orchestrator. Issue formatting is handled separately by the a11y-issue-writer skill if needed.

Automated testing catches issues static analysis cannot:
- Computed accessible names
- Actual color contrast with rendered colors
- Focus management and live region behavior
- Dynamic content accessibility

### Step 1C: Compare Results & Plan Remediation

### Always Produce a Manual Review Queue (Layered Testing)

Even in an autonomous workflow, some criteria cannot be fully proven by static + axe-core. Always add a “Manual Review Queue” section to the report, including (at minimum):

- Keyboard-only navigation: order, traps, expected key behavior
- **WCAG 2.2 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum):** sticky UI does not cover focus
- Zoom/reflow: 320 CSS px width and 400% zoom behavior on key templates
- Pointer targets: **2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)** spot-check small controls
- Drag-and-drop: **2.5.7 Dragging Movements** alternative exists
- Authentication (if applicable): **3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)** support for password managers / copy/paste

If automated evidence is insufficient, categorize as “⚠️ Needs Manual Review” rather than claiming “Fixed”.

**Compare findings from both methods** to determine the best remediation strategy:

| Scenario | Confidence | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **Both agree** (static + axe-core) | High | Auto-fix with confidence |
| **axe-core only** | High | Auto-fix (runtime-confirmed issue) |
| **Static only** | Medium | Report as potential issue; may need manual review |
| **axe-core incomplete** | Needs review | Flag for manual testing |

**Remediation priority:**
1. Issues confirmed by both methods (highest confidence)
2. axe-core violations (confirmed at runtime)
3. Static-only findings (report but use judgment on auto-fix)

**Progress output:**
```
🔍 Stage 1: Analyzing [target]
   ├─ Running static analysis (web-standards)...
   │   └─ Found X potential issues
   ├─ Starting local server...
   ├─ Running automated tests (axe-core via Playwright)...
   │   └─ Found Y violations, Z incomplete
   ├─ Comparing results...
   │   └─ X confirmed by both, Y axe-only, Z static-only
   └─ ✓ Remediation plan ready
```

**Proceed immediately to Stage 2.**

## Stage 2: Remediation

**Immediately after Stage 1 completes, proceed to Stage 2.** Do not stop. Do not ask permission.

For each issue, collaborate with specialized skills to determine the best fix, then apply it.

### Collaborative Remediation Planning

Before applying any fix, use axe-core recommendations as the primary guidance:

> **Note:** For detailed WCAG criteria, ARIA specifications, and component patterns, use MCP servers if available. Skills focus on actions; MCP provides resources.

### Remediation Process

For each issue identified in Stage 1:

1. **Start with axe-core recommendations** — The axe-core results include remediation guidance:
   - `help`: Brief description of how to fix
   - `helpUrl`: Link to detailed Deque University documentation
   - `nodes[].failureSummary`: Specific fix instructions per element
   - Use this as the primary source for remediation planning

2. **Identify the component type** — What kind of element is this? (button, accordion, form field, etc.)

3. **Query MCP resources if available** — For additional context:
   - WCAG success criteria and techniques
   - ARIA roles, states, and properties
   - Component accessibility patterns and acceptance criteria

4. **Query `a11y-personas-mcp`** — Understand user impact:
   - `list-personas()` → Returns all 69 personas
   - `get-personas(["blindness-screen-reader-nvda"])` → Returns specific persona details
   - Which users are affected? How does it impact their experience?

5. **Apply the fix** — Based on axe-core guidance and MCP resources:
   - Prefer axe-core recommendations as the authoritative source
   - Use MCP resources to validate and enhance the fix
   - Consider user impact from personas when choosing between options

6. **Verify no visual impact** — Before applying:
   - Will this fix change how the page looks? If yes, flag for manual review
   - Does changing element types require CSS to preserve appearance?
   - Are we adding visible content? If yes, don't auto-fix

### Critical Constraint: No Visual Changes

**Clarification:** Some accessibility fixes *may* require visible changes to be truly effective (e.g., strengthening focus indication). If a fix materially affects visuals, do not silently change design; instead:
- apply only if it preserves the intended design system behavior, or
- flag as “Needs Manual Review” with a suggested, minimal design-safe approach.

**Fixes must be invisible to sighted users.** The page design MUST NOT change visually. Accessibility improvements happen "under the hood" through:
- Adding/fixing attributes (ARIA, alt text, labels)
- Changing element types while preserving appearance (div → button with CSS reset)
- Adding programmatic relationships (aria-labelledby, aria-describedby)
- Fixing JavaScript behavior (keyboard handlers, focus management)

**If a fix would change the visual design, flag it for manual review instead of applying it.**

### Critical Constraint: Remediate, Don't Add

**Only fix issues in code that already exists.** Do NOT:
- Add headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) that weren't in the original code
- Add landmark elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`) that weren't there
- Add new structural elements that change the page design
- Add content or elements the designer/developer didn't include

**DO:**
- Fix accessibility issues in existing elements (add labels, fix ARIA, add alt text)
- Modify existing elements to be accessible (change `<div onclick>` to `<button>`)
- Add attributes to existing elements (`aria-expanded`, `aria-label`, etc.)
- Report structural issues (missing h1, missing landmarks) as "Needs Manual Review" for the developer to decide

### Fix Output Format

For each fixable issue, document:

```markdown
### Issue #N: [Brief description]

**axe-core Guidance:**
- Rule: [rule ID]
- Help: [help text]
- Deque Docs: [helpUrl]
- Fix suggestion: [failureSummary]

**WCAG:** [Success criterion if known]
**Personas affected:** [Query a11y-personas-mcp]

**Before:**
```html
[original code]
```

**After:**
```html
[fixed code]
```
```

For complex issues requiring manual review, document:
- Why auto-fix isn't appropriate
- Recommended approach for developer

**Progress output:**
```
🔧 Stage 2: Applying fixes
   ├─ Issue #1: [description]
   │   ├─ axe-core recommends: [fix suggestion]
   │   ├─ Checking personas... [X users affected]
   │   └─ ✓ Fix applied
   ├─ Issue #2: [description]
   │   └─ ...
   └─ ✓ Applied X fixes (Y need manual review)
```

**Proceed immediately to Stage 3.**

## Stage 3: Validation

**Immediately after Stage 2 completes, proceed to Stage 3.** Do not stop. Do not ask permission.

Verify that applied fixes resolve the issues.

### Validation Process

1. **Re-run tests** - Use `a11y-tester` skill to re-test the modified code (navigate and run axe-core again)
2. **Verify fixes resolved issues** - Compare before/after axe-core results
3. **Categorize results:**
   - ✅ Fixed - Issue no longer detected
   - ⚠️ Needs Manual Review - Cannot be automatically verified
   - ❌ Still Failing - Fix did not resolve the issue

**Progress output:**
```
✅ Stage 3: Validating fixes
   ├─ Re-running accessibility tests...
   ├─ Checking acceptance criteria...
   └─ ✓ X/Y issues resolved

📄 Report complete
```

**Output the final report. The workflow is now complete.**

## Report Template

Generate the final report using this structure:

```markdown
# Accessibility Remediation Report

**File:** [filename or URL]
**Date:** [current date]
**Status:** [emoji] X/Y confirmed issues resolved

## Summary

| Source | Issues | Fixed | Manual Review |

## Needs Manual Review (axe-core Incomplete)

### Issue #N: [Brief description]
- **axe-core Rule:** [rule ID]
- **Reason:** [Why automated testing couldn't determine pass/fail]
- **Guidance:** [Link to relevant documentation]

## Potential Issues (Static Analysis Only)

These issues were identified by static code analysis but NOT confirmed by automated testing. Review and address as needed:

### Issue #N: [Brief description]
- **Category:** [ARIA/Semantic HTML/Keyboard/etc.]
- **Recommendation:** [Suggested fix]
- **Note:** Not auto-fixed; requires developer decision

## Validation Summary

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| axe-core violations re-tested | X |
| Confirmed fixed | X |
| Still failing | X |
| Incomplete (manual review) | X |
| Static-only (not auto-fixed) | X |
```

## Handling Different Input Types

### HTML File
Run full static analysis. Runtime testing if file can be served.

### URL
Run both static (fetch source) and runtime (Playwright) analysis.

### Code Snippet
Run static analysis only. Provide fixes inline.

### Component/Framework Code
Identify framework (React, Vue, etc.) and adapt patterns accordingly.

## Quick Reference: Skill Delegation

| Task | Skill | Key Information |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Static code analysis | `web-standards` | HTML/ARIA/semantic issues |
| Runtime testing | `a11y-tester` | axe-core violations (raw format) |
| Format issues | `a11y-issue-writer` | Standardized issue reports from violations |
| Generate fixes | `a11y-remediator` | Applies accessibility fixes |
| Verify fixes | `a11y-validator` | Confirms issues resolved |
| Base patterns | `a11y-base-web` | Foundational requirements |

## MCP Resources (External)

For detailed reference data, query these MCP servers:

> **Philosophy:** Skills are "doers" — they perform actions. MCP servers are "resources" — they provide reference data. Skills query MCP servers when they need specifications or patterns.

## Skills and MCP Integration

### Skills (Actions)

- **a11y-tester**: Runs axe-core tests and returns raw violations
- **a11y-issue-writer**: Formats violations into standardized issue reports (uses accessibility-issues-template-mcp)
- **a11y-remediator**: Applies fixes to code
- **a11y-validator**: Validates fixes
- **web-standards**: Performs static code analysis

**Workflow:** a11y-tester collects violations → a11y-issue-writer formats them (optional) → a11y-remediator fixes them → a11y-validator confirms

### MCP Servers (Resources)

MCP servers provide reference data that skills query during execution:

- **accessibility-issues-template-mcp**: Templates for formatting violations as issues (used by a11y-issue-writer)
- **wcag-mcp**: WCAG success criteria and techniques
- **aria-mcp**: ARIA roles, states, properties
- **magentaa11y-mcp**: Component accessibility patterns
- **a11y-personas-mcp**: User personas and impact information

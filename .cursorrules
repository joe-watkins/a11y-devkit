# Sync Claude Skills to Cursor

Use this rule when the user wants to sync agents and skills from `.claude` to `.cursor/{agents,skills}` and generate an `AGENTS.md` overview.

## Trigger Phrases

- "sync skills"
- "sync claude to cursor"
- "update cursor skills"
- "generate agents overview"

## Sync Process

### Step 1: Copy Directories

Copy and overwrite the following directories from `.claude` to `.cursor`:

1. **Skills**: Copy `.claude/skills/` to `.cursor/skills/`
2. **Agents** (if exists): Copy `.claude/agents/` to `.cursor/agents/`

Use recursive copy to preserve directory structure and all files.

### Step 2: Parse SKILL.md Frontmatter

For each skill directory in `.cursor/skills/`, read the `SKILL.md` file and extract the YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Description of what the skill does and when to use it.
---
```

Extract the `name` and `description` fields from each skill.

### Step 3: Generate AGENTS.md

Create `AGENTS.md` in the project root with an overview table of all available skills:

```markdown
# Available Skills

Overview of all skills synced from the Claude meta-framework.

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| skill-name | Description from SKILL.md frontmatter |
| ... | ... |

## Usage

Skills are located in `.cursor/skills/`. Each skill contains a `SKILL.md` with detailed instructions and may include:

- `data/` - Reference data and resources
- `scripts/` - Executable scripts
- `references/` - Additional documentation
- `assets/` - Templates and assets

To use a skill, reference its `SKILL.md` for guidance on when and how to apply it.
```

### Step 4: Confirm Completion

Report the sync results:
- Number of skills synced
- Number of agents synced (if any)
- Location of generated `AGENTS.md`
